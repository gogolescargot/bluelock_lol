# BlueLock League of Legends

### This project consist of get data from custom games from .ROFL files ( replay files ) to create a leaderboard for personal tournaments.
### Using the [roflxd](https://github.com/fraxiinus/roflxd.cs) implemention in C# from [Fraxiinus](https://github.com/fraxiinus).
### Riot doesn't allow you to get custom games data from their API so we use replay files to get all the data.
